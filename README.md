# CChannel Arduino Project
### Program By: Reese Ford, Samuel Simonian, and Johnathan Bonilla
### Hardware By: Liam Stewart, Zoe Pillai, Rose Tidwell
Created: 10/24/2023\
Last Updated: 12/01/2023\
Created for Baylor University Course EGR 3380 (Junior Design) - Fall 2023

## What this code does
This program drives a Transfer Subsystem for the Junior Design 2023 Project where our goal was to take 2 types of cases (designated "Green" and "Gold") stack them in a 2x2x2 on a pallet where each 2x2x1 was of a single color. The starting color was determined at the beginning of each pallet run.

## How can I run this code
The code requires a very specific set of hardware constructed for the purpose of this project, which is almost impossible to replicate, for better or for worse...

The name CChannel comes from an inside joke where we recieved a weird ["C" of V-Rail](https://pasteboard.co/OwPPk2CprXwo.jpg) instead of what we actually ordered
