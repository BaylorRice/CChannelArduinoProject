# CChannel Arduino Project

Created for Baylor University Course EGR 3380 (Junior Design) - Fall 2023

## What this code does
This program drives a Transfer Subsystem for the Junior Design 2023 Project where our goal was to take 2 types of cases (designated "Green" and "Gold") stack them in a 2x2x2 on a pallet where each 2x2x1 was of a single color. The starting color was determined at the beginning of each pallet run.

## How can I run this code
The code requires a very specific set of hardware constructed for the purpose of this project, which is almost impossible to replicate, for better or for worse...

## The Device (approx CAD)
